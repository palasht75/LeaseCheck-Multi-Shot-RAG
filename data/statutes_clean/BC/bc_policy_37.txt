B. Related Guidelines Specific information on each of the types of permitted rent increases under Part 3 of the RTA and Part 4 of the MHPTA can be found in the following Policy Guidelines: • Policy Guideline 37A: Annual Rent Increase • Policy Guideline 37B: Agreed Rent Increase • Policy Guideline 37C: Additional Rent Increase for Capital Expenditures (ARI-C) • Policy Guideline 37D: Additional Rent Increase for Expenditures (ARI-E) C. Legislative Framework The following sections describe permitted rent increases under Part 3 of the RTA and Part 4 of the MHPTA. Residential Tenancy Act Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act (RTA) (MHPTA) RESIDENTIAL TENANCY POLICY GUIDELINE GL37-2 37. Permitted Rent Increases May 24 • section 43 • section 36 Under section 36 of the MHPTA and section 43 of the RTA, a landlord may impose a rent increase only up to the amount: • calculated in accordance with the regulations (“annual rent increase”), • agreed to by the tenant in writing (“agreed rent increase”), or • ordered by the director on an application in the circumstances prescribed in the regulations (“additional rent increase”). Section 40 of the RTA sets out that a “rent increase” in Part 3 of the RTA does not include an increase that is for one or more additional occupants and is authorized under the tenancy agreement. See Section F of this Guideline for more information. D. Timing Requirement Under section 35 of the MHPTA and section 42 of the RTA, a landlord can give a rent increase once every twelve months after: • the date on which the tenant's rent was first payable for the rental unit or site, or • if the tenant's rent has previously been increased, the effective date of the last rent increase. For example, the landlord gives the tenant an annual rent increase that takes effect on January 1, 2022, and then applies for and is granted an additional rent increase under section 23.01 of the Residential Tenancy Regulation (Regulation) in March 2022. The additional rent increase cannot take effect before January 1, 2023 (and is given with the annual rent increase for 2023). Similarly, the landlord and tenant cannot mutually agree to a rent increase six months after the annual rent increase took effect. The director cannot change the timing requirements for rent increases. E. Notice Requirement The landlord must give the tenant a completed Notice of Rent Increase form at least three months before the effective date of the rent increase. The approved form for each type of permitted rent increase must be used when serving notice. The approved forms are available on the Residential Tenancy Branch Forms webpage. RESIDENTIAL TENANCY POLICY GUIDELINE GL37-3 37. Permitted Rent Increases May 24 F. Additional Occupant Clauses In accordance with section 13 (2) (f) (iv) of the RTA, if the amount of rent payable is to vary with the number of occupants, parties must set out in their written tenancy agreement the amount by which it varies. If an additional occupant resides in the rental unit, the rent will increase by the amount specified in the tenancy agreement. If an occupant stops residing in the rental unit, the rent will decrease by that same amount. If the tenancy agreement does not include a term that the rent varies based on the number of occupants, a landlord cannot increase the rent because a new occupant begins to reside with the tenant. It is important to note that, in accordance with section 40 of the RTA, an increase based on an additional occupant is not considered a rent increase under Part 3 of the RTA. Therefore, the notice and timing requirements for these other rent increases do not apply. Section 22.1 of the RTA restricts a landlord from increasing the rent based on the number of occupants due to the addition of: • An occupant who is a minor, or • an occupant who, when the tenancy agreement was entered into, was a minor and an occupant but is no longer a minor. A “minor” means a person who has not yet reached the age of 19 (as established by sections 1 and 4 of the Age of Majority Act). The following are examples of how this restriction applies if the tenancy agreement states that the rent varies based on the number of occupants: • Example 1: If a family begins a tenancy and their 17-year-old child is also an occupant of the rental unit, a landlord can never increase the rent in relation to that child, even once that child turns 19 years-old. If that child, whether before or after they turn 19, moves away for a period of time, and then returns to the rental unit, the landlord also cannot increase the rent. • Example 2: If a tenant begins a tenancy and their 17-year old friend is not an occupant of the rental unit when the tenancy begins but their friend becomes their roommate (an occupant) when their friend is 18-years old, the landlord RESIDENTIAL TENANCY POLICY GUIDELINE GL37-4 37. Permitted Rent Increases May 24 cannot initially increase the rent in relation to the 18-year-old moving in. When that friend turns 19-years-old, however, the landlord can impose the additional occupant rent increase. • Example 3: If a parent with a three-month-old baby begins a tenancy, the landlord can never increase the rent in relation to that child, even once that child turns 19 years-old. If six months later, that parent’s new partner moves in with their own thee-month old baby, the landlord can increase the rent in relation to the parent’s partner if the required term is in the tenancy agreement, but cannot increase the rent in relation to the second baby until that baby turns 19-years-old and then only if they are still an occupant of the unit. If, prior to May 16, 2024, a landlord increased the rent in relation to an additional occupant who is or was a minor, that rent increase remains in effect. Terms in tenancy agreements that provide for rent variances based on the number of occupants will not be enforceable if the amount by which the rent would increase is unconscionable because it is grossly unfair to a tenant. See Policy Guideline 8: Unconscionable and Material Terms for more information. G. Policy Guideline Intention The Residential Tenancy Branch issues policy guidelines to help Residential Tenancy Branch staff and the public in addressing issues and resolving disputes under the Residential Tenancy Act and the Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act.
